# web-labs

# 9 lab task: 
Description: Implement interaction with your REST API server.

# Requirements:

All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
## Code style:
- For any http request - use axios library
- All your API functions should be separated into single file (or folder, if you want) - just like you saw in Live coding for 5 lab with fetch() function
## Functionality:
- On Catalog Page - all items should now be fetched from your backend with GET method (using axios)
- Search with filters - should also be implemented with GET request (search by text field can be left as it is)
- Before response from your GET method is received you have to display a Spinner(Loader component) to the user.
